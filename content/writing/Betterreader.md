# Become a better reader with these 6 killer apps & mental models
11-12-2022 <br> 7 min read


We live in the information golden age where we can access all books ever written with just a few clicks. Sadly, the abundance of data also comes with negative side effects. For example, we see the internet running on advertisements, which is a way to commoditize and exploit our attention spans. This has led to a deterioration of our focus in favor of easy and accessible dopamine bites. Thankfully we can avoid such downsides by controlling *how* we approach information. 

In this article, I'll provide a 4-step process, including helpful apps and tactics, for getting the most out of books.

# Step I: Filling up your Digital Bookshelf

The aim is to collect **all** potentially interesting information that comes your way. Whether that be a friend's book recommendation, some posts you found on Medium, or a study mentioned on one of your favorite podcasts. It all should come together in one place. By starting from a large bookshelf, we ensure we have enough options to filter and pick out the gems later.

## 1. Create a centralized inbox with [Notion.so](https://notion.grsm.io/w2nmytt9w3h8)

There are several apps and methods for creating a centralized inbox to capture all your information. Notion.so is my digital tool of choice since it's quick, easily accessible across all devices and platforms, and highly flexible. I wrote a post detailing the setup [here](https://medium.com/@edwindoit/the-benefits-of-an-airtight-read-it-later-workflow-in-notion-free-guide-template-d3aa9a588978).

## 2. Look for "Lindy" books on [mostrecommendbooks.com](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/)


Shiny object syndrome and FOMO is depriving us of valuable insights. New does not necessarily equal novel or good. In fact, there's actually an opposite correlation at play. If a book has been accepted as great for 50 years, the [“Lindy" effect"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect) states that it’s probable to remain great for another 50. For this reason, it’s more likely that you’re getting value from something that’s stood the test of time. *(Note that it's just more likely, it doesn't mean that new information can't be valuable. All valuable information starts off as new at some point).* 

A terrific way to find Lindy books is by looking at the world's most influential people who recommend them as their favorite books. You'll notice that these are frequently the classics. The folks at most recommendbooks.com have done a great job at compiling such lists [www.mostrecommendedbooks.com](https://www.mostrecommendedbooks.com/?source=post_page-----f161273fd2c--------------------------------)

# Step II: Pre-screen the items on your Digital Bookshelf

In step I, the goal is to gather as much potentially useful information as possible. But, now that it's time to decide what to spend your time on, you must be deeply criticial and selective. Bill Gates famously says that you should finish the books you start no matter what. While that *might* foster willpower, it will certainly ensure you waste time on books that don't interest you, or, worse, make you hate reading. The better strategy, also preached by the likes of Naval Ravikant, is to asses books like blog posts. Scroll through them and pre-screen the information!

## 3. Read the summary before reading the book with [Shortform.com](http://shortform.com/edwindoit)

Summaries are a fantastic way to be introduced to a book. Having a quick look at the core ideas will help you understand if the book is right for you. 

Some of the best book summaries the ones produced by Shortform. My favorite characteristics of Shortform are:

- **The depth and quality of the summaries:** They have a 1-page, 10-minute summary, as well as deep dives on every section of the book. They don’t just condense the information but also restructure and criticize the book's explanations. I found this very helpful with Nassim Taleb’s books in the Incerto series because his writing can be quite emotional and chaotic at times.
- **The fact that they reference, integrate, and cross-examine insights from other books**. This is amazingly useful to give you a broader overview of the topic, and also presents you with inspiration for future reading.
- **Audio versions of all of the guides.** You can listen to a voice-over version of the summaries, which is great if you’re on the go and just want to get a quick glimpse of what it's about.

Shortform releases new book guides every week, and subscribers get to vote on what books to cover.

## 4. Get to know the author by listening to podcasts and interviews
Another great way to quickly asses whether you deem an book worthwhile, is by listening to an author's podcast appearance or interview. Listening is easy while on the go, and the podcast format is ideal for acquainting yourself with the take-home points. Because of the time constraints, the author must condense his message into his or her most compelling narrative. I recommend searching for podcasts on [Youtube](http://youtube.com/) or the Podcast app [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) (I find it's significantly better than the default Apple podcast app).

# Step III: Read the book as effectively as possible

How you read is just as important as what you read. Being focused, comfortable, and energized is the foundation of a great reading session. Secondly, Maximizing speed is counterproductive when distilling the information in a book. Going slow and pausing to think is the superior strategy. Counting the number of books you rack up is just a vanity metric.

## 5. Use a digital reader to make in-context notes and import highlights with [Readwise.io](http://readwise.io/)


There's nothing wrong with paper books, but digital reading has strong advantages. The fact that it takes up less space, and that it's easier to read in the dark are the practical benefits. But in addition, using an e-reader (app) such as Kindle makes highlighting, bookmarking, and leaving in-context notes much easier. A way you can make the most of your notes is to automatically import them with an app called Readwise. Readwise syncs in your highlights and notes and presents them to you regularly so that you remember them better: [readwise.io](https://readwise.io/?source=post_page-----f161273fd2c--------------------------------)

# Step IV: Digest the book
The best way to gauge if you understand a book is by being able to explain it in simple terms. Richard Feynman and Albert Einstein have argued that true mastery is explaining something in words that a child would understand without any complex and fancy jargon. However, breaking information down into first principles is just the first half of the process. Part 2 is either assimilating or accommodating it into your existing knowledge structure. Assimilation happens when new information reinforces an existing understanding. Whereas, accommodation occurs when you encounter something novel that requires you to alter the very structure of your worldview.

## 6. Integrate your learnings into a personal knowledgebase, such as the KEE Productivity system



The KEE productivity system is designed to guide the entire digesting process. While reading the book, you are directed to write your notes and link them to your existing knowledge sections. Let's say you're reading the business book Zero To One. After you articulated the core insights of the book, you'd look at your current "Business knowledge", and assess how it fits in. Insights could be analogous, identical, or contradicting your current understanding of business, and you'd have to adjust your existing point of view accordingly. The constructing of your own knowledge is the strongest form of knowledge: explanatory knowledge. It's far better than mindlessly remembering insights and quotes that are not your own and will not hold up in broader and more complex contexts.
