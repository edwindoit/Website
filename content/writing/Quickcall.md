# Fast Choices, Optimal Results: How the Quick-Call Method Powers Effective Actions Under Pressure

29-10-2023 <br> 3 min read


There’s a constant tension between the theoretically optimal solution and the one that is feasible. The limiting factor is almost always howmuch time do we have and howmuch complexity can we deal with. The best strategies follow a slower, rational and precise approach that also considers human pitfalls. For instance, our emotional influences and cognitive biases. Practitioners regularly ignore such strategies and rely on their raw experience or wisdom because of the high potential time investment. Luckily, there is also a way to select strong courses of action without sacrificing large amounts of time.

In this article, I describe the framework I created for making "quick calls" based on rules. The Quick Call tool is available as a free [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/w2nmytt9w3h8) template, which can be found at the end of the article.

# Acting, Fast and Slow

A fantastic book by the late Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow, explains our decision-making through the lens of two systems: systems 1 (fast and survival-based) and system 2 (slow and precise). I believe that not only our decision-making, but all the actions we perform on a day-to-day basis, should be viewed through this lens. Learning, goal-setting, time-management, and planning are examples of this. By distinguishing and specifying each type of action, we can specify optimal, as well as, faster forms of execution. And, this is what I intended The 4 Acts model to provide.

# The 4 Acts cycle of human action

The 4-act cycle of human action is: Understand, Choose, Do, Learn. Every action we take falls into these 4 Acts. In the 4 Acts model, each act breaks down into distinct sub-steps. I choose to organize the quick-rules by these sub-steps, which are chapters in the 4 Acts book. Information on the complete 4 Acts model & book can be found [here](https://edwindoit.com/4acts).


# **Fast Actions: Using The 5 Acts Within the Quick Call Tool**

So how do we get from the comprehensive model of the sub-actions, to making quick calls? The answer is to condense them down into simple and easy to use rules. A rule is a short statement that specifies what to do, or not to do. Acting from rules is also the straightforward translation of “reasoning from mental models” or “avoiding cognitive biases”. It comes down to assessing the situation, finding what rules suit it, and then deciding upon the appropriate course of action. Practically, these are the steps involved:

1. **Identify the type of action** you’re faced with. The types of actions (sub-steps) are chapters of The 4 Acts book.
2. **Evaluate the rules** and select the ones which are most fitting to the situation.
3. **Decide and apply** the most suitable course of action based on the rules.

# 60+ evidence-based rules for optimal actions

Everyone has a different context, which warrants specific rules that apply to your circumstances. Therefore, you are encouraged to add your own rules to the Quick Call tool. However, the tool also comes with 60+ universal rules derived from the 5 Acts book. Notable sources include:

- David Deutsch’s epistemology of hard-to-vary explanations & fallibilism
- Nassim Taleb’s work on strategies in the face of uncertainty
- Richard Dawkin’s selfish-gene version of evolutionary theory
- Game theory and microeconomics as interpreted by Naval Ravikant

Below, you will find examples of several rules for three of the action types: 1) Solution generation, 2) Solution selection and 3) Plan creation.

# Get the Quick Call tool Notion template

I turned the Quick Call tool into a free Notion template, which you can get [here](https://edwindoit.gumroad.com/l/qc)

It  includes:

- A complete and easy-to-search overview of the action types (chapters) from the 5 acts Model
- 60+ default rules and the ability to add your own rules based on your specific context
- Detailed instructions and customization options

Note that it is currently out of date as the 4 Acts book is not yet definitive. Once it is, this template will receive an update.
