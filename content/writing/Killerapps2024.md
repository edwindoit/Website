# Killer apps to organize your digital workspace — 2024 edition

This is the digital setup I use to be more effective in 2024. The purpose of my workspace is to optimize focus and eliminate distractions. This article is an updated version of [last year's one] and includes many new desktop apps as well as my “dumbphone” setup.

# My desktop setup

## [**Notion**](https://notion.grsm.io/w2nmytt9w3h8)


I use [Notion](https://notion.grsm.io/w2nmytt9w3h8) to organize and record basically everything: my goals, tasks, notes, documentation, and workflows. Its strength is keeping everything organized, actionable, and available. I used to use a to-do app on the side, but I streamlined it to just Notion. I specifically use the KEE productivity system to organize my workspace. You can read more about it and get the template for free [here](https://medium.com/@edwindoit/theres-a-new-productivity-framework-in-town-the-kee-system-explained-notion-template-included-f30855683504).

## [**Arc browser**](https://arc.net/)



I love [Arc](https://arc.net/). I don’t use all its features, but I use the ones I do constantly. Arc is command-line optimized, so I can browse quickly without using my mouse. It also allows you to hide the unnecessary address bar and tabs so you can focus only on the screen in front of you. Lastly, the split screen mode is super convenient for comparing web pages.

## [Biscuit](https://eatbiscuit.com/) browser for communications

I recommend separating your communication apps from your main browser. There are several reasons for this. 
- It declutters your browser. 
- You use them often, so it’s practical to have them in one place. 
- When you need to focus and block all communications, close that one window, and they are all gone. [Biscuit](https://eatbiscuit.com/), in particular, has a handy feature that rolls up your notifications into the sidebar icon, giving you a clear overview.

***Sidenote:** 
I used to use StackBrowser, but it became too bloated and slow for my liking. Tools like Texts.com and Beeper combine all your message apps into one tool, but I have strong security concerns about those so will not try them.*

## [**Notion Calendar**](https://www.notion.so/product/calendar)

I started dabbling with [Notion Calendar](https://www.notion.so/product/calendar) in my last article (when it was still called Cron). It’s since become my favorite calendar app because it’s simple and has a sweet topbar widget and scheduling feature. I don’t use the Notion integration as often, but you can create a super-integrated workflow where your calendar and notes are synced.

## [MenubarX](https://menubarx.app/) (Mac Only)



[MenubarX](https://menubarx.app/) is a convenient way to place small apps at arm's reach. It’s a little browser window in the top bar. I use it for YouTube music and ChatGPT, but there are many other apps to try. For example, notes, a to-do list, a calendar, or e-mail.

# My dumbphone setup

I have an iPhone as my everyday smartphone, but around 21:00, I put it away and switched to my Boox Palma "dumbphone". The point of a dumbphone is to maintain the convenience of a phone but avoid the addictive and stimulating apps. There are several ways to create a dumbphone. Firstly, you can create a dumb "mode" for your smartphone; there are [excellent tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek2eo5lrZws&ab_channel=Reysu) on YouTube on how to do that. However, it will always remain possible to switch back to the regular smartphone. Another way is going barebone with a flip phone (or something like that). But, then, you’ll miss many features (maps, banking apps, authenticators, etc.). For a while, these were the only 2 options, but with the BOOX Palma, there’s a third one, and it's delightful.

The BOOX Palma is a phone-sized tablet (without cellular) that runs Android, but what makes it unique is its E-ink display — the same display you get in e-readers. The screen is pleasant on the eyes and perfect for reading. It’s not distracting because it's black & white, and it has a low refresh rate (this also delivers an impressive battery life). Amazingly it’s still running Android, and that means all your favorite reading and audio apps can be easily used as well! This is what I currently have on mine:

1. My [**Meditation app**](https://meditationapp.wixsite.com/download-app) of choice. It's free, simple, and works.
2. A big widget of all my latest [**Notion**](https://notion.grsm.io/w2nmytt9w3h8) pages
3. [**Audible**](https://www.audible.co.uk/?source_code=AUK30DFT1BkWS0826159058&ipRedirectFrom=US&ipRedirectOriginalURL=) for audiobooks
4. **Shortform** for the best book guides: https://shortform.com/edwindoit *(You’ll receive 5 days of unlimited and unrestricted access and an additional 20% discount on the annual subscription.)*
5. A [**Notion**](https://notion.grsm.io/w2nmytt9w3h8) shortcut to capture new thoughts quickly
6. The [**Reader App by Readwise**](http://reader.readwise.com/). This is an excellent read-it-later app; I intend to make a longer post on this in the future.
7. My E-Books
8. More e-books in the Kobo app
9. Even more e-books in the Kindle app

The last thing I'll highlight about the BOOX Palma is the size. It comfortably fits in your pocket and is much more portable than other e-readers.
