# Thoughts on the art of introduction

When attempting to condense information, we tend to **summarize** and make it more abstract. Intuitively this seems like it would communicate more because it covers more, but in fact, it **says less**.

“I aim to spread knowledge” might sound like a good way to condense: “I broadcast free online lectures on computer science on Youtube and Skillshare,” but it’s not. You turned something concrete and understandable into something vague.

Summarizing also turns information into generic, utopian, and virtuous statements. Phrases like: “Helping people is my north star” may seem wonderful initially, but you’re not saying anything different or contrarian. Ask yourself: who would disagree with that statement? If the answer is practically nobody, you're likely just *virtue-signaling*.

So if summarizing is so laced with problems, then what is the right approach to take? I propose the following method:

1. Describe X amount of specific and understandable statements about the subject that you're introducing
2. Select the statements that convey the essential and most important information for the given situation. Less is more.
3. Iterate on those statements to make them as sticky and punchy as possible.

You can try and apply this in a bio, resume, elevator pitch, networking event, or whatever other situation you need to introduce something.
