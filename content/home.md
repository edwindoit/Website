## I aim to make the systems and laws that govern reality simple to understand. In other words, to give a straightforward description of how the world around us works.

## I do this because I believe **the fundamental explanations of reality** lead us to the most suitable course of action.

> *“If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough” - Albert Einstein.*
> 

To comprehend complex ideas, we need to understand the basics of logic. If someone can only describe something using intricate words, high-level abstractions, or highly specific comparisons, they likely don't understand what they're talking about. Hammering down the basics is the best way to build our knowledge.

I describe these basic building blocks of knowledge and apply them to construct techniques for optimal selection, execution, and learning. This includes strategies for: 

- Reasoning in the face of complex systems
- Setting killer goals
- Consuming information effectively
- Running and coordinating your teams & businesses
- Optimizing energy and attention levels
- Taking responsibility (only) for all that you can control

## What I’m currently working on

- 📑 [The 4 Acts Book](https://www.notion.so/The-4-Acts-model-0f1d1e318fa343649b43edddef6fb33a?pvs=21) → My definitive breakdown of how the world works and how to apply the knowledge gained from it

## This is the place for you if you also enjoy these topics:

- Reality, human nature, and science
- Leaving the world better than you found it
- Improving your effectiveness through self-awareness and specifying your intentions
- Social and Technological innovations with a focus on decentralization
- Human Progress through innovation
- Popperian epistemology

## And, probably the wrong place if you're a fan of:

- Merely optimizing how efficient or productive you are
- Talking about issues but not solving them
- Short-term zero-sum success over long-term win-win dynamics
- (Tech) doomsday prophecies following the precautionary principle
- Believing that unsolvable problems exist
- Unfalsifiable theories such as macroeconomics and postmodernism

## My background

I’m a techy with strong organizational and leadership skills:

- Active within and founder of [social impact initiatives](http://nederlandmaaktimpact.nl) since **2018**
- From design intern to product manager to COO at [Formelio](http://Formelio.nl). From start-up to scale-up to stay-up. **2018 - 2023 and running**
- [Notion](http://notion.so) evangelist since **2020**

## What I believe in

- Accelerating Human Progress
- Critical rationalism (Popperian & Deutschian Epistemology)
- Optimalism & Effectiveness
- Rational optimism

> **I seek to bridge the gap between complex theories and real-world applications by making dense information understandable, decision-making simple, and murky problems clear.**
