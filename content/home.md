## About
I'm passionate about effectiveness. The 4 Acts (my book) is a distillation of the lessons I learned from my own research as well as from building and running a software business. I define being effective as making progress towards a desired outcome. This differs from being productive. Productivity is just about maximizing output and efficiency, without regard for direction. Effective action requires more than just productivity. It's also about reflecting on your goals and questioning what's important.






### My background



Iâ€™m a techy with strong organizational and leadership skills:
- Active within and founder of social impact initiatives since 2018
- From design intern to product manager to COO at Formelio. From start-up to scale-up to stay-up. 2018 - 2024 and running
- Notion evangelist since 2020





### What I believe in



- Accelerating Human Progress
- Critical rationalism (Popperian & Deutschian Epistemology)
- Optimalism & Effectiveness
- Rational optimism


### In a nutshell

I seek to bridge the gap between complex theories and real-world applications by making dense information understandable, decision-making simple, and murky problems clear.
